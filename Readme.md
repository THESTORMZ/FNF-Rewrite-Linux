## FNF VS. REWRITE LINUX
there is no source for this, so you will have to look in releases.

>the files in the rewrite mod were not fully compatable with linux Psych Engine. this was because of capitalisation in the files (Linux is very case sensitive)

>the repo that made this possible was: https://github.com/Munoida/FNF-PsychEngine-Linux-Releases
i cant compile anything for the life of me.

For Debian based distros you will need to run:
```sudo apt-get install luajit```

You will prob need luajit on other distros but i know nothing about them so i cant rly help there.
